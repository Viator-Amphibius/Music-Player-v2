To simplify the sequence diagram, we can do either of the following in the class diagram:
1- We can store all the public subscription in an Arraylist in the MusicPlayer so we can iterate
over them directly without going to every single user and testing if they have a public subscription.
2- We can put IncreaseSongLimit() as an abstract method in the Subscription class, and implement it normally in
the publicSubscription subclass and implement it using empty methods in the other two subclasses.
This way we still have to iterate over all users, but we won't have to test if their subscription is premium or not.
Compared to the previous solution, this one saves some memory by not having an Arraylist of all public subscriptions.
